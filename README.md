# Ridiculously Simple Analytics for Chrome Extension

A ridiculously simple implementation of Google Analytics in a Chrome extension for when you just want to start making stuff.

Sends a Google Analytics event when you click on the Google Search logo.

## Setup

 * Set up your Google Analytics account.
 * Create a custom Analytics event.
 * In background.js replace UA-XXXXXXXX-XX with your Analytics id.
 * Go to chrome://extensions, make sure developer mode is turned on and load this source as an Unpacked Extension.

## Why did I do this?

This is part of a series of ridiculously simple, executable code examples. 

Sometimes we need to cut through the documentation jungle and start making stuff.
